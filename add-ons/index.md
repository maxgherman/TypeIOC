# Add-ons

Add-ons are designed to extend basic functionality. They are optional but might be useful in different cases. The main entry point of add-ons is 'typeioc/addons' sub-folder. From there different add-ons are used in a different way.

```typescript
import * as Addons from 'typeioc/addons';
```
