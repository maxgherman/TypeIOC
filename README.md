# TypeIOC

Dependency injection container for TypeScript / JavaScript.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/typeioc.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/typeioc)

<br/>

The idea of dependency injection is not new and TypeIOC is not trying to reinvent the wheel. But it was rather written with one idea in mind - simplicity, think fancy hash table.
How to use it is, well up to the user. One way would be to go full SOLID principles and effectively manage class dependencies. Another way is more functional and requires techniques like factories and functional composition. Whichever way is chosen, TypeIOC can help.

## Installation

    npm install --save typeioc
<br/>(yarn works as well)
